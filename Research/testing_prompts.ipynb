      "Okay, I need to find the integral of x. Hmm, I remember that integrals are related to antiderivatives. So, I think I should recall the power rule for integration. The power rule says that the integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. In this case, n is 1 because we're integrating x, which is the same as x^1.\n",

      "Applying the power rule, I'll increase the exponent by 1, which changes 1 to 2, and then divide by the new exponent. That should give me (x^2)/2. Don't forget to add the constant of integration, C, because the derivative of any constant is zero, so it doesn't affect the original function when differentiating.\n",

      "Wait, let me double-check. If I differentiate (x^2)/2, I should get x, right? Using the power rule for differentiation, the derivative of x^2 is 2x, and dividing by 2 gives x. That matches the original function I was integrating. So, I think I did that correctly.\n",

For f(x) = x, the graph is a straight line, and the area under it from 0 to some point a would form a triangle. The area of a triangle is (base * height)/2, which in this case would be (a * a)/2 = a^2/2. That aligns with the integral I found, reinforcing that the solution is correct.\n",

      "* **Probability Density Function (PDF):**  A function that describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. The PDF is not a probability itself; rather, the probability of a random variable falling within a given range is found by integrating the PDF over that range.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's imagine a continuous random variable, say the height of adult women.\n",

      "* **PDF:**  The PDF would show the probability density for different heights. It would peak at the most common height and taper off as you move away from that peak. The area under the entire PDF curve would equal 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **CDF:** The CDF would show the cumulative probability of a woman being of a certain height or shorter. For example, the CDF at a height of 5'4\" would represent the probability that a randomly selected woman is 5'4\" or shorter.\n",
